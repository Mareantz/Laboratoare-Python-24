# Write a function that receives a single dict parameter named mapping. This dictionary always contains a string key
# "start". Starting with the value of this key you must obtain a list of objects by iterating over mapping in the
# following way: the value of the current key is the key for the next value, until you find a loop (a key that was
# visited before). The function must return the list of objects obtained as previously described. Ex: loop({'start':
# 'a', 'b': 'a', 'a': '6', '6': 'z', 'x': '2', 'z': '2', '2': '2', 'y': 'start'}) will return ['a', '6', 'z', '2']


def loop(mapping: dict) -> list:
    result = []
    key = "start"
    while key not in result:
        result.append(key)
        key = mapping[key]
    return result


mapping1 = {'start': 'a', 'b': 'a', 'a': '6', '6': 'z', 'x': '2', 'z': '2', '2': '2', 'y': 'start'}
print(loop(mapping1))
