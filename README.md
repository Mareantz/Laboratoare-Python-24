## Features

- **Graphical User Interface**: Intuitive and responsive UI built with Tkinter.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Play against another human player over a network.
- **AI Opponent**: Single-player mode against a simple AI.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Instantaneous synchronization of game state between clients and server.
- **Dice Mechanics**: Realistic dice rolling with visual representation.
- **Move Validation**: Ensures all moves adhere to Backgammon rules.
- **Bore Off Functionality**: Proper handling of bearing off pieces to win the game.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and game tracking.

## Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter**: For building the GUI.
- **Socket Programming**: For network communication between server and clients.
- **Pickle**: For serializing and deserializing game state data.
- **Threading**: To handle multiple client connections concurrently.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mareantz/Laboratoare-Python-24
   cd BackgammonProject
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   This project uses only Python's standard libraries, so no additional installations are required.

## Usage

### Running the Server

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd BackgammonProject
   ```

2. **Start the Server**

   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

   The server will start and listen for incoming client connections on `127.0.0.1:12345`.

### Running the Clients

1. **Open a New Terminal Window for Each Client**

2. **Start the Client**

   ```bash
   python client.py
   ```

3. **Choose Game Mode**

   - **Play vs AI**: Play against the computer.
   - **Play vs Human**: Connect to the server and play against another human player.

4. **Select Your Color**

   Choose between White or Black when prompted.

### Automated Setup

A helper script `run_this.py` is provided to launch the server and two clients simultaneously in separate console windows.

1. **Run the Automated Script**

   ```bash
   python run_this.py
   ```

   **Note**: This script is designed for Windows due to the use of `creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE`. Modify accordingly for other operating systems.

## Game Controls

- **Roll Dice**: Click the "Roll Dice" button to initiate your turn.
- **Select and Move Pieces**: Click on a triangle (point) containing your pieces to select it, then click on a valid destination to move.
- **Bore Off**: Once all your pieces are in the home quadrant, use the "Bore Off" button to remove pieces from the board.
- **Dice Representation**: Used and unused dice are visually distinguished to track available moves.
